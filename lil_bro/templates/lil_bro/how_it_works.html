                    <p>
                        To enhance security and avoid storing user data in plain text within the database, this project
                        leverages the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service in conjunction with the
                        aws_encryption_sdk library. This service enables the generation and secure storage of an
                        encryption key, which is then employed by the library to encrypt data in a secure manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The data is available for viewing via the link only once, then it is permanently deleted. Tip to
                        increase security: Use a passphrase. It can even consist of a single character, but without it,
                        even with a link, it is impossible to get access to the secret.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-center">How to use the service</h4>
                    <p>
                        To create a secret, fill out the form and click on the "Create" button, in response you will
                        receive a link that you can send to the recipient in any convenient way. By clicking on the
                        link, the recipient will see the secret text that you left for him.
                    </p>
